Virtual LANs, or VLANs, are like separate departments within a big company. In a regular LAN, all devices are connected together and can communicate with each other directly. But with VLANs, we can divide the LAN into smaller groups or departments. 

Devices in different VLANs can still communicate, but they need to go through a router or a switch to reach devices in other VLANs. It's like needing to go through specific checkpoints to visit different neighborhoods. 

VLANs help us organize and secure our network by keeping different groups of devices separate while still allowing them to interact when needed.

Broadcasts from one VLAN does not get to other VLANs and vice versa.
